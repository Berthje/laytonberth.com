                                filled with ups, downs, and unexpected turns.
                                This is the complete, unfiltered story of how I
                                went from struggling to secure a 12‑month
                                internship for my third-year bachelor’s program
                                to finally landing a Technical Student
                                Internship as a Fullstack Developer at CERN.
                                Read on for every twist and turn.

                            </h5>

                            <p>
                                I was required to search for a 3–4‑month
                                internship as part of my third-year bachelor’s
                                program. Ever since I can remember, I had
                                dreamed of landing an internship in the USA. I
                                spent at least eight months chasing that
                                dream—but thanks to COVID, securing a US
                                internship became a bureaucratic nightmare.
                                American companies were reluctant to deal with
                                all the paperwork, so I reluctantly let that
                                dream rest… at least for the time being.
                                However, I vowed that one day I’d still chase
                                that dream, even if I had to start somewhere
                                else.

                            </h5>

                            <p>
                                After accepting what I perceived as a “failure”
                                in not finding an internship abroad, I turned my
                                focus to companies in Belgium. I applied rather
                                late, still clinging to my hope of a USA or
                                Canada placement. Fortunately, I received an
                                offer from one of my dream companies in
                                Belgium—Spatie, renowned for its Laravel
                                packages and innovative projects. It became my
                                safety net, a solid fallback option if nothing
                                else caught my eye.

                                Not content with simply settling, I broadened my
                                search. I applied to big-name companies like
                                Palantir and Google in hopes of “upping my
                                game.” I even got redirected—via the principal
                                of Katowice University of Economics—to a big
                                Polish company. Despite the potential, I turned
                                it down because living in Katowice for 3–5
                                months just didn’t feel exciting enough

                            <p>
                                I honed my search to organizations that
                                resonated with my passions: ESA, CERN, Stripe,
                                and JetBrains. While ESA and Stripe weren’t
                                interested in my application, I managed to
                                secure an interview with JetBrains—and, more
                                importantly, I decided to give CERN a try.
                                <br /><br />
                                I applied to CERN—whose locations span
                                Switzerland (Geneva) and France—with a “YOLO”
                                mindset. Deep down, I believed I had no chance.
                                Nonetheless, I gathered every document they
                                required: school grades, my resume, details of
                                my experiences, and proof of skills in math,
                                languages, physics, and more. A huge shoutout
                                goes to my amazing tutor, Dimitri Casier, who
                                kindly wrote me a recommendation letter.

                                One of the hurdles was a SONRU test. In short,
                                SONRU is a brief online assessment that
                                evaluates both your technical and interpersonal
                                skills—a quick way for CERN to gauge if you’re
                                the right fit. I submitted the test and then
                                pretty much forgot about it.
                                <br />
                                About a month later, while I was at the gym, I
                                received an email that made my heart skip a
                                beat:
                                <br /><br />
                                <span class="text-i fw-bold"
                                    >“You have been selected as a possible
                                    candidate. We would like to interview
                                    you.”</span
                                >
                                <br /><br />I was shocked. The email mentioned
                                that the interview would involve theoretical
                                coding tests, and for a moment, I considered
                                skipping it. After some intense deliberation, I
                                decided to give it a shot—not only for the
                                chance of landing the internship but also to
                                gain valuable interview experience. I prepared
                                using the STARR method, brushed up on LeetCode
                                exercises (albeit with only moderate success),
                                and reviewed general coding conventions.
                                <br /><br />
                                A week later, I booked a room at the university,
                                grabbed my laptop, and nervously awaited the
                                interview with two lead developers. They asked
                                me a mix of theoretical questions and practical
                                challenges—for example, how to implement a
                                solution in Java without using a traditional
                                for-loop (I answered by suggesting the Stream
                                operator). There were also questions on React
                                and databases, reflecting the fullstack nature
                                of the Technical Student position at CERN.
                                <br />
                                I managed to answer about 60–70% of the
                                questions, though some topics were outside my
                                comfort zone.
                                <br />
                                When they asked about my availability, it turned
                                out they were looking for someone for a one-year
                                commitment—far more than the 3–4 months I had in
                                mind. I explained that I could do at most 3–5
                                months (maybe 6 months in a pinch). They said
                                they’d consider it and get back to me.

                                A few weeks later, I received an email
                                congratulating me on being selected for the
                                position—starting in February—but with a
                                one-year minimum commitment. I was ecstatic,
                                almost in disbelief, wondering if I was
                                hallucinating. However, when I consulted the
                                internship coordinator at my university, Howest,
                                I was told that a one-year internship was not
                                feasible. With a heavy heart, I had to decline
                                the offer. I informed Dimitri of the bittersweet
                                news; he remarked, “This is really sad, but it’s
                                great to see you got accepted.”

                                Shortly after, the CERN interviewer emailed me
                                saying I was the best candidate they had
                                interviewed—and that he was genuinely
                                disappointed I couldn’t accept due to the
                                duration mismatch. I felt my hopes dwindle to
                                zero.

                                Then, a couple of days later, Dimitri reached
                                out again:

                                My hopes skyrocketed to 300% once more. Soon
                                after, CERN approved the possibility of a
                                one-year internship. I immediately replied to
                                the interviewer, saying, “My university and I
                                have reached an agreement that I can do an
                                internship for one year.” Unfortunately, he
                                responded that the spot had already been filled
                                by the second-best candidate. I was
                                devastated—another blow to my already fragile
                                hope.

                                Determined, Dimitri and Francois (where I was in
                                a meeting with to discuss this situation) asked
                                me to share the interviewer’s contact
                                information with Howest’s higher-ups. After
                                weeks of emails and back-and-forth calls, the
                                interviewer came back to me with some promising
                                news. He arranged another interview for a
                                different group within the department. This
                                time, I met with the product owner/supervisor
                                and a tech lead developer. The interview was
                                much less technical—since they already knew I
                                was qualified—and focused on practical questions
                                like “Could you handle deadlines?” and “Are you
                                interested in financial aspects?” Within just
                                three hours after the interview, I received
                                another email. I hesitated to open it, fearing
                                another rejection, but eventually did so in the
                                solitude of my bedroom. And there it was:

                                The acceptance was life-changing. However, the
                                celebration was short-lived as I was immediately
                                plunged into a mountain of paperwork—documents,
                                contracts, and final arrangements that took
                                between one and three months to finalize. Next
                                came the logistical challenge of moving from
                                Belgium to Switzerland (Geneva). This move has
                                been a real challenge for me since I did it all
                                on my own. I never even mastered the art of
                                handling day-to-day tasks and paperwork in my
                                own country, let alone in Switzerland. Learning
                                how to live independently, manage unfamiliar
                                bureaucratic processes, and navigate a whole new
                                environment has pushed me out of my comfort
                                zone. It’s been a steep learning curve, but
                                every challenge is a step toward growth and
                                self-reliance—and I'm determined to make it
                                work, no matter what.

                            <p>
                                Housing turned out to be a major headache. After
                                some time, I found a modern (2023-built) student
                                residence that turned out to be amazing—no
                                regrets about renting here for the entire year.
                                I then had to plan my transport to Geneva to
                                ensure I arrived by 3:00 PM (15:00) on February
                                1st, since my first working day was on February
                                3rd at 8:15 AM (08:15)—which was also one day
                                before my birthday! Flying wasn’t an option
                                because I needed to bring along my monitors,
                                gaming PC, office desk and chair, and personal
                                decorations.
                                <br /><br />
                                Fortunately, after a couple of weeks, my dad
                                offered to help by transporting everything in a
                                medium-sized van. Huge thanks to Dad for that! I
                                also had to visit my local town hall to update
                                my address (since I was no longer a Belgian
                                resident)—a task that needed to be completed the
                                day before my arrival. Setting up a bank account
                                was next; I chose UBS because they’re
                                well-versed in dealing with CERN’s temporary
                                interns, although I plan to switch to Yuh later.

                                With everything set up and my belongings packed
                                (pans, kitchen utensils, and more), it was time
                                to say goodbye to my mother, girlfriend, and
                                friends. For my last night before departure, my
                                girlfriend surprised me with an evening at
                                Mozart—a popular Volonté Ribs restaurant in
                                Bruges. I thought it would just be the two of
                                us, but when I arrived, I found a table of 12
                                people. She had organized a heartfelt farewell
                                party complete with many presents (thanks to all
                                my friends and, of course, my amazing
                                girlfriend).

                                On the morning of departure, we left at 5:40 AM
                                (05:40). The mix of emotions was
                                overwhelming—leaving behind everything familiar
                                was far tougher than I imagined, but sometimes
                                you must take bold steps to achieve your dreams.
                                The road trip took approximately 9 hours, with
                                several stops along the way.

                                I finally arrived on Friday, January 31st—a day
                                earlier than planned because I discovered at the
                                last minute that in Switzerland you can’t move
                                in on the weekends (customs and real estate
                                offices are closed for key transfers). After a
                                quick tour of my new, surprisingly spacious
                                studio, my dad checked into the hotel next door
                                and left in the morning, leaving me to face this
                                new chapter entirely on my own.

                                I reached CERN at 7:30 AM (07:30) to pick up my
                                access badge (I was buzzing with excitement!).
                                Then, at 8:15 AM (08:15), I attended an
                                introductory session in a striking wooden

                                by 60–100 fellow students, we enjoyed a quiz,
                                breakfast, and a session filled with fascinating
                                insights about CERN. Shortly thereafter, our
                                department supervisor introduced us to our new
                                office and integrated us into the team—an
                                experience that made me feel right at home.

                                While CERN’s offices might not boast the
                                ultra-modern aesthetics of some tech giants, I
                                appreciated the academic, slightly “lived-in”
                                vibe. I now have a setup with three monitors and
                                a reliable desktop PC—a perfect combination for
                                a student space where creativity meets a touch
                                of organized chaos.

                            <p>
                                On my first day at CERN, after settling in and
                                picking up my access badge, I took a moment to
                                explore the corridors of the building. It was
                                incredible to stumble upon a hallway where, as
                                legend has it, Tim Berners-Lee once worked.
                                Right there hangs a sign that proudly states
                                "Where the WEB was born" Knowing that this
                                historic spot is just a stone's throw away from
                                my own office added an extra layer of excitement
                                and inspiration to my journey.

                            <p>
                                The onboarding process was extensive. My fellow
                                graduate colleague (a “GRAD”—someone who has
                                just gained a bit of professional experience
                                post-graduation) and I spent 4–5 days working
                                through countless onboarding documents,
                                installing essential tools, and familiarizing
                                ourselves with the department’s procedures and
                                project diagrams.

                                As of this writing—Friday, February 7th,
                                2025—I've wrapped up the onboarding. Now begins
                                the real work: getting to know the codebase, the
                                tools, and the procedures for the three to four
                                projects I’ll be contributing to (with one
                                project being my main focus at the moment). I
                                even made my first pull request today—a simple
                                update to the README file to correct the
                                outdated build and run command. That small
                                change marked my first speaking moment during
                                our daily standup meeting, and it was incredibly
                                exhilarating.

                            <p>
                                Officially, CERN’s working hours are from 9:00
                                AM to 6:00 PM (09:00–18:00), including a
                                one-hour lunch break. However, I’ve found that I
                                prefer to start my day early, arriving at 7:30
                                AM (07:30). I typically take only a 30-minute
                                lunch break, which means I often leave around
                                4:00 PM (16:00). Of course, if meetings or extra
                                tasks extend my day, I adjust by arriving later
                                the following day—since the rule is eight hours
                                of work per day, any overtime allows for a
                                delayed start.

                                Every step of this journey—from the initial
                                failed attempts at landing a US internship to
                                the nerve-wracking interviews and the final
                                joyous acceptance at CERN—has taught me
                                something invaluable. Today marks not just the
                                beginning of my work at CERN, but also the start
                                of a new chapter filled with learning, growth,
                                and the pursuit of passion. I’m excited to dive
                                deeper into my projects, contribute to
                                innovative solutions, and continue evolving as a
                                developer and as a person.

                                seems filled with setbacks. Remember, sometimes
                                the road to your dreams is anything but
                                straightforward, but every twist and turn brings
