                                I recently participated in the Erasmus Blended
                                Intensive Project (BIP) on "Trends in Research
                                and Innovation in the Context of Computer
                                Science" at FH St. Pölten University of Applied
                                Sciences. This program was a significant step
                                outside my comfort zone, as the focus was on
                                AI—a topic I’m not particularly familiar with.
                                Attended by top Master’s and PhD students, many
                                of whom had interned at companies like Google,
                                Amazon, and Meta, this experience was both
                                humbling and inspiring.

                            <p>
                                Our group consisted of members from India,
                                Germany, and Romania, and we used design
                                thinking to tackle common tourist challenges. We
                                brainstormed solutions to issues like language
                                barriers, navigating public transportation,
                                demand forecasting for tourism businesses, and
                                enhancing experiences at cultural heritage
                                sites.

                                The result was <b><i>TripTailor</i></b
                                >, an all-in-one app featuring an AI chatbot.
                                Users could input preferences, and the AI would
                                generate a personalized itinerary complete with
                                a detailed map, easy booking options, and 3D
                                views of tourist attractions. This project was
                                not only a technical exercise but also an
                                opportunity to think creatively and
                                collaboratively. <br /><br />
                                Presenting our solution to professors and fellow
                                students was a thrilling experience. The
                                positive feedback we received was incredibly
                                validating, and it underscored the importance of
                                our hard work.

                                While the academic aspect was rewarding, the
                                personal connections I made were equally
                                impactful. I wouldn’t say I made lifelong
                                friends, but I had fascinating conversations and
                                knowledge exchanges with brilliant people. Some
                                of them had interned at Meta, Amazon, Google,
                                and even Jane Street. As someone who dreams of
                                interning or working at these companies (see my
                                CERN post ;)), interacting with these
                                individuals was surreal.

                                One memorable night stands out. We visited
                                Vienna and caught the night train home. Though
                                we had valid tickets (which were a struggle to
                                get), the train was packed beyond belief. When
                                some passengers with reservations showed up, we
                                had to vacate our seats and were left standing,
                                squished like sardines. To make matters worse,
                                ticket inspectors decided our valid tickets
                                weren’t sufficient, and we were thrown off the
                                train. Coincidentally, we met a couple from our
                                project—both Google interns—who had been
                                similarly kicked off despite their valid
                                tickets. While waiting for the last train, which
                                was crucial for getting back in time for school
                                the next morning, they lightened the mood by
                                teaching me salsa dancing.
                                <br /><br />
                                On the journey back, I had a deep conversation
                                with Andrei, one of the participants. He was
                                incredibly impressed with my work, but I
                                couldn’t help but admire his achievements:
                                stellar grades, published papers, and
                                internships at top companies like Google,
                                Amazon, and Jane Street. He even shared insights
                                into the application processes, which I found
                                fascinating and motivating.

                                Unfortunately, not everything went smoothly. One
                                day, I fell ill and had to leave early due to
                                severe stomach issues. I missed some of the
                                presentations on advanced research topics, which
                                was disappointing because the ones I did catch
                                were incredibly impressive. The projects
                                showcased cutting-edge AI and computer science
                                innovations, making me feel like a small fish in
                                a big pond. While I couldn’t grasp all the
                                technical details, I appreciated the brilliance
                                behind the ideas.

                                The trip wasn’t all work and no play. We
                                indulged in a lot of schnitzel, enjoyed
                                cocktails with colleagues, and savored Iberico
                                ham at a lovely restaurant. On Day 3, we visited
                                the United Nations headquarters, where an active
                                conference on physics and chemistry was taking
                                place. Seeing the meeting rooms, complete with
                                country placards, and exhibits like a replica of
                                Neil Armstrong’s spacesuit and a moon rock was
                                absolutely thrilling.

                                Our exploration of Vienna included visits to

                                an academic program; it was a transformative
                                journey. It broadened my understanding of AI,
                                exposed me to high-level research, and gave me
                                the opportunity to collaborate with
